\title{Bayesian models for characterizing trait-based species interactions.}
\usage{
integratedModel(pars, Tlevel1, Tlevel2, mean_Tlevel1, sd_Tlevel1)
}
\arguments{
\item{pars}{parameters obtained from fit.niche.prob function or a vector of the form c(a0 = 0, a1 = 0, b0 = 0, b1 = 0) with known parameters.}

\item{Tlevel1}{Vector of trait values of the first interaction partner.}

\item{Tlevel2}{Vector of trait values of the second interaction partner.}

\item{mean_Tlevel1}{Mean of trait values of the first interaction partner. Can be weighted or not,
and can use independent information on the trait distribution to be calculated.}

\item{sd_Tlevel1}{Standard deviation of trait values of the first interaction partner. Can be weighted or not,
and can use independent information on the trait distribution to be calculated.}

\description{
This models are described in Bartomeus et al. 2016 (Functional Ecology) and are based
on Williams et al. 2000 models. They are intended to be used with fit.it function. The integrated model
considers both neutral and niche constraints, while the neutral and niche models only consider its respective
components.
