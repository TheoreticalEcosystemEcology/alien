\title{Format data for the \code{alien} class}
\usage{
as.alienData(dfNodes, dfEdges, trait = NULL, phylo = NULL, taxo = NULL,
  siteEnv = NULL, traitSp = NULL, traitInd = NULL, phy = NULL,
  dfSite = NULL, dfOcc = NULL, binary = FALSE, directed = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dfNodes}{A vector or a data frame with at least one column named \code{idNodes} providing
unique identifiers for each species identified within the dataset. The remainig
columns could be either traits or phylogenetic or taxonomic data that must
be specified respectively by \code{trait}, \code{phylo} or \code{taxo}
parameter described below.}

\item{dfEdges}{A data frame with at least two columns: \code{idFrom} and \code{idTo}
descibring the set of edges. If \code{directed} is set to \code{TRUE} is also
describes the direction of the interaction. Two additonnal columns are checked
\code{value} \code{iDsite} which respectively stand for the value associated
with the edge and where the interaction has been observed.}

\item{trait}{A vector indicating columns number (or names) of \code{dfNodes} containing traits data (see \code{Details}).}

\item{phylo}{A vector indicating colums number (or names) of \code{dfNodes} containing phylo data (see \code{Details}).}

\item{taxo}{A vector indicating columns number (or names) of \code{dfNodes} containing taxo data (see \code{Details}).}

\item{dfSite}{A data frame with at least two columns named \code{idFrom}}

\item{dfOcc}{A data frame with at least two columns}

\item{binary}{Logical. If `TRUE`, interactions are turned into a boolean variable (see \code{Details}).}

\item{directed}{Logical. If `TRUE` (default value) the network is considered as directed (see \code{Details}).}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Should extra information be reported on progress?}
