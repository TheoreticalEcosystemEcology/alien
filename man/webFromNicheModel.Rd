\title{Generate a web using the niche model.}
\usage{
webFromNicheModel(nbsp, connec, connect_all = FALSE, unbias = FALSE,
  niche = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{nbsp}{an integer giving the number of species considered.}

\item{connec}{a real positive between 0 and .5 indicating the connectance
of the network to be generated.}

\item{unbias}{logical. If TRUE, then the first species may not be a basal species.}

\item{niche}{a vector real positive between 0 and 1 standing for the niche axis.
Default is set to \code{NULL}, in such case the niche axis is automatically generated.}

\item{connec_all}{logical. If TRUE, then all species in the network have a
least one prey (but the niche with the lowest niche value).}
}
\value{
A logical matrix describing pairwise interactions. A given line
describe the diet of a given species while a column decribes the set of
predator accociated to a particular species.
}
\description{
This function is an implementation of the niche model which generates
food webs based on 1- a number of species, 2- a niche axis and 3- a value of
comnectance.
}
\details{
Three remarks. First, according to Williams and Martinez (2000),
the species with the lowest niche value is considered as a basal and thus
has no trait. This introduces a slight bias (\emph{e.g} the
expected connectance is lower than the expected values \code{connec}). Second,
forcing all the species to be connected introduces another biais (connectance)
tends to be more connected than expected.
Third, if one uses its own customed niche axis, values should be between 0 and
and 1 and the expected connectance (\code{connec}) can vary significantly if the
distribution of niche values differ from the uniform distribution used in
Williams and Martinez (2000)
