### Development practices

- the `master` branch is protected -- code can only make the master branch after a pull request, that has must be apporved by @SteveViss @KevCaz @guiblanchet
- everyone work on branches in this repo
- `git fetch` / `git pull` before you do anything else
- good commit messages are 72 chars max on the first line and explain what has been done in the imperative tone. A good rule of thumb is that if you say "If merged, this commit will" before the commit message, it should be a sentence. For the sake of example, a good commit message is: "*add information about development practices*" while a bad one could be "*CONTRIBUTING changes*"
- if the branching complexity of your function is > 3 (number of nested for / if / while), rewrite


### Style Guide

- function names are explicit and with `CamelCased` verbs, *e.g.* `SimulatesNicheModel`.
- objects are declared with lowercase, underscores and small caps, *e.g.* `trophic_level`
- namespaces with `::` (e.g `reshape2::acast`)
- Packages dependencies are declared in the `DESCRIPTION` (import section)
- all `roxygen2` flags (e.g. @param etc.) are to be set up.
- R extension file has to be written in capital letter (e.g `fitBayesReg.R`)
